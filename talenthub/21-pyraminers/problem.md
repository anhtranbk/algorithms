Lara Croft is a pyraminer, or tomb rider in the same language with those Holywood people. She hunts for golden trophies inside Egypt's ancient maze. Every ancient maze has only one real one and a bunch of fake trophies. For every maze, she is able to estimate exactly the number of trophies in there, and amount of time she and the team can be inside, before the maze changes itself and make them lost there way there.



To find the real trophy she needs to summon Egypt alchemists. It takes a while for any alchemist know if it is a fake or a real trophy. Please help her to estimate the number of alchemists need for the maze.
