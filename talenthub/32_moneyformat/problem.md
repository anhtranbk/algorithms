Johny travels to Laurino, a small country in center of Mars. Here they count money in very weird ways. 
Dlog is their currency. 
Ju is unit for 10, 1 Ju Dlog is 10 Dlog. 
Hu is unit for 100, 1 Hu Dlog is 100 Dlog 
Tu is unit for 1000, 1 Tu Dlog is 1000 Dlog 
Mu is unit for 10000, 1 Mu Dlog is 10000 Dlog 
Pu is unit for 100000, 1 Pu Dlog is 100000 Dlog 
Bu is unit for 10000000000, 1 Bu Dlog is 10000000000 Dlog

So this is how they name their price in supermarket.

2 Pu 1 Mu 7 Tu 5 Hu 7 Ju 7 Dlog

It's mean that the Price is 217577, in our ways of counting. Consider 1 Dlog = 1cent
